Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator 
called an are reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototype
 suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden 
 almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the
  workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit powers up. The armored
   Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' 
   weapons and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued
    by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will cease manufacturing weapons.
     Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may
      ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, 
      more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for
       it and his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor 
inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.
